# Advertising-Expenditure
This project predicts sales based on advertising expenditures across TV, radio, and newspaper using regression models. The goal is to optimize ad spend for maximum ROI by identifying the most effective channels. Includes model evaluation, fine-tuning, and actionable insights for strategic budget allocation.
The dataset contains advertising expenditures across three media channels—TV, radio, and newspaper—and the corresponding increase in sales for 200 different months. For any business, strategic advertising is essential to drive product awareness, increase popularity, and boost sales. However, it's crucial to optimize advertising investments to maximize return on investment (ROI). Excessive spending without careful planning can lead to wasteful expenditure without substantial returns.

This project aims to implement regression techniques to predict the increase in sales based on advertising budgets allocated to different media channels. By analyzing the data, we will explore how investment in each channel impacts sales and identify the most effective strategies for maximizing ROI.

The workflow includes:

Data exploration and preprocessing.
Implementation of various regression algorithms (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, etc.).
Model evaluation and tuning to achieve the best performance.
Deriving actionable insights for optimizing advertising budgets.
Through this analysis, businesses can make informed decisions about their advertising strategies, ensuring the right amount is spent on TV, radio, and newspapers for maximum sales impact.

This repository contains the code, analysis, and models used for predicting sales based on advertising spend and extracting insights that can guide investment decisions.
